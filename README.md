# FEA_LTB
Brief: A programme for the estimation of lateral-torsional buckling of beams
1. The total potential energy is derived from "Liu Zhanke, Zhou Xuhong. An analysis on completeness of total potential energy of thin-walled members with flexural-torsional buckling. Engineering Mechanics, 2017, 34(7): 1–10. (in Chinese)"
2. The method of FEA mainly referred to "Barsoum R S , Gallagher R H . Finite element analysis of torsional and torsional–flexural stability problems. International Journal for Numerical Methods in Engineering, 1970, 2(3):335-352." 
and "Lu Liewu, Shen Shizhao, Shen Zuyan, etc. Stability of steel structural members. 1st ed. Beijing: China Architecture & Building Press, 1983: 86–91. (in Chinese)"
3. Major charactoristics: 
(1) The programme is coded on MATLAB 2016a and it is suggest to run it on this platform.
(2) Employing the excel "Sample.xlsx", it is able to estimate a batch of the critical moments of beams, whose dimensions, loadings and boundary conditions vary simultaneously.
(3) It has great agreement with the result presented by LTBeamN, a widespread FEA programme created by CTICM.
